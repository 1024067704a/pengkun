## Notes
- **Formal Groups and Lubin-Tate theory:** This is a note I wrote for the course Topics in Algebraic Topology. It cantains an overview of Lurie's construction and classical construction of Morava E-theory. [<a href="PDF-Personal Web/Lubin-Tate.pdf">Notes</a>]

- **Introduction to K-theory:** During the summer holiday of 2022, a friend and I organized an unofficial student seminar in which I gave several talks introducing topological and algebraic K-theories.[<a href="PDF-Personal Web/k-seminar.pdf">Notes</a>]. The other part is in [Shuaishuai Duan](https://shuduan.github.io/sduan/).
  
- **Steenord Algebra:**
  This is a note based on Lurie's lecture of Sullivan Conjecture, explaining the construction and properties of Steenord operations by using homotopy orbits.[<a href="PDF-Personal Web/steenord.pdf">Notes</a>]
  
- **Study Report on Extoic Spheres:**
  This is a note writing on a graduate course Topics in differential geometry, introducing isoparametric foliations and DDBD structure on extoic spheres.
